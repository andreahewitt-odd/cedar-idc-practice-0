## Problem Statement

Currently, Veterans that meet the requirements to receive agent orange disability benefits must fill out the necessary forms and provide the supporting documents on paper. This elongates the process because often veterans will be missing information and have to go back and forth several times before the office that processes the application even has all the documentation to make the decision.

## Solution

Digitize the experience. Build a digital application process that can work on any device but within the MVP, the focus is on iPads.

The tool will show applicants everything they need to provide before they submit the application so the decision maker has everything they need to make that decision and won’t have to go back to ask for documentation. This should speed up the process. 

The tool will store all information or forms the veteran inputs over time because VSO has let us know it can take veterans 6-months and beyond to retrieve all the necessary documents to apply for this application

## KPIs
- Time between kick off of the app to submitted app
- Time between submitted app to response from review office
- Number of people that get to a “no” after the qualifying questions
